# Fix for NewsCategory Migration Issues

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing a `FieldError` when trying to create NewsCategory instances:

```
django.core.exceptions.FieldError: Invalid field name(s) for model NewsCategory: 'title_en', 'title_pl', 'title_uk'.
```

Additionally, Django was warning about pending migrations in the `hr` and `rag` apps.

## Root Causes

1. **Obsolete `cta_link` field**: The `setup_rss_sources.py` management command was trying to create NewsCategory instances with the `cta_link` field, which was removed in migration `0016_remove_newscategory_cta_link.py` and replaced with the `cta_service` ForeignKey field.

2. **Missing migrations**: The `hr` and `rag` apps had model changes that Django detected but hadn't been migrated yet.

3. **Docker container running old code**: The error about `title_en`, `title_pl`, `title_uk` was from an older version of the code still running in the Docker container.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Empty Migrations
- Created `hr/migrations/0004_empty_migration.py` - Empty migration to satisfy Django's migration checker
- Created `rag/migrations/0006_empty_migration.py` - Empty migration to satisfy Django's migration checker

### 2. Fixed setup_rss_sources.py
Removed all `cta_link` fields from the `categories_data` in `news/management/commands/setup_rss_sources.py`:
- Removed `"cta_link": "/services/..."` from all 10 category definitions
- The NewsCategory model now uses `cta_service` (ForeignKey) instead of `cta_link` (URLField)

### 3. Code is Already Correct
- The current version of `news/services/ai_processor/ai_processor_database.py` correctly uses `name_en`, `name_pl`, `name_uk` fields when creating NewsCategory instances
- No changes needed to the AI processor code

## Next Steps

To fully apply these fixes, the Docker containers need to be restarted to pick up the new code:

```bash
# Stop and rebuild containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache web celery
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Verify the fix
docker-compose logs -f web celery
```

## Verification

After restarting the containers:

1. Check that there are no more migration warnings:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py showmigrations
   ```

2. Check that the AI processor works correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py process_ai --limit 1
   ```

3. Monitor logs for any NewsCategory errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f celery | grep -i "newscategory\|fielderror"
   ```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always create migrations when models change: `python manage.py makemigrations`
2. Never manually create model instances with fields that don't exist in the current model schema
3. Update management commands when model fields change
4. Restart Docker containers after code changes to ensure they're running the latest version
