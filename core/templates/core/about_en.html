      <h2>Born to automate.<br>Fired for it.</h2>

      <p>The project born out of necessity, driven by curiosity, and fueled by unapologetic laziness.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm the founder of Lazysoft, and once you finish reading this page, you‚Äôll understand why I picked this name (and maybe feel a bit lazy yourself).</p>

      <p>I pivoted into techat the age of 37. Before that, I had built a career in tourism, logistics, and marketing ‚Äî mostly in roles that required constant human interaction (a nightmare for an introvert with tattoos and a love for automation).</p>

      <p>Then came maternity leave. I returned to work when my baby was just 5 months old, only to discover that my job duties had vanished into thin air. I was given odd tasks, without real purpose. That is, until someone dumped an Everest of Google Sheets data on me ‚Äî hundreds of thousands of rows to analyze and turn into reports. It was grueling. I worked in SMM, not data science!</p>

      <p>Within weeks, formulas broke under the weight of the data. I was drowning in copy-paste. Out of desperation (and curiosity), I discovered Python. I wrote my first scripts in Notepad. Within a month, I had a fully automated system that generated reports in under 5 minutes.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, I had nothing to do at work. My tasks were done faster than anyone could assign them. So, I built a mouse clicker bot to stay "active" in Teams. I was eventually for that.</p>

      <p>But no regrets. I optimized myself out of a job. And that‚Äôs the beauty of laziness: it‚Äôs not about doing nothing. It‚Äôs about not doing pointless things.</p>

      <p>That‚Äôs how <span class="highlight-green">Lazysoft</span> was born.</p>

      <p>Today, Lazysoft is a growing IT collective. We automate, build, and create tools that do the work for you. From bots and data processing to creative solutions and full-stack projects. We mix culture with code, tradition with tech, and humor with hustle.</p>
